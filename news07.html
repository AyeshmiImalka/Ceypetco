<p style="margin:180px; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 40px;"> 
	Cash-strapped Sri Lanka sharply hiked fuel prices yesterday to a record high, causing further pain to the country’s 22 million people in its worst crisis since independence.


<br/><br/><br/>
	
	The South Asian island nation has suffered months of dire shortages and anti-government protests, which turned deadly earlier in May with at least nine people killed.

<br/><br/><br/>

	Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said a newly appointed “economic war cabinet” approved the new rates to stem huge losses at the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corp.
	

<br/><br/><br/>

	The price of diesel was raised from 289 rupees ($0.80) to 400 rupees a litre, a 38-percent jump, while the cost of a litre of petrol was increased from 338 to 420 rupees. 

<br/><br/><br/>

	Diesel prices have increased 230 percent and petrol has gone up 137 percent in the past six months.

<br/><br/><br/>

	An acute foreign exchange shortage has led to widespread scarcity of fuel, food and medicines while the population are suffering high inflation.    

<br/><br/><br/>

	The census office reported that the overall inflation last month was a staggering 33.8 percent year on year. 

<br/><br/><br/>

	Sri Lanka last month announced a sovereign default on its $51 billion foreign debt and is in talks with the International Monetary Fund to secure a bailout.  

<br/><br/><br/>

	The government imposed a broad import ban in March 2020 to save foreign currency as dollar inflows slowed.  

<br/><br/><br/>

	The pandemic compounded the country’s economic woes triggered by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s drastic tax cuts in 2019 as part of his election pledge.

<br/><br/><br/>

	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took office last week after the protest violence forced the resignation of his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of the president.

<br/><br/><br/>

	Protesters are continuing to demand the president quit, and the country is still without a finance minister to conduct urgent bailout talks with the IMF.
